Iovis is an implementation of an AgentSpeak interpreter that includes a meta-
level reasoning action library, and plans to process and comply to norms.
With Iovis, a developer can deploy agents that change their plan libraries
in reaction to norms from the environment, or from other agents.
More on the operation of Iovis can be read in the following paper:

agents. Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Autonomous Agents 
and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS), Budapest, Hungary, 2009.

In order to operate a normative system, one must include the actions from
org.kcl.iovis.reflect in the Jason classpath (available in the library 
iovis.jar), and include the source code from iovis.asl into the desired agent.

An example of how norms are encoded and used throughout the software can be 
found at examples/norms, which includes an agent whose plans are modified
during the execution of the script normsScript.xml.
